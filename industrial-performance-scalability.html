          <p>Blockchains must have high performance and scalability to deliver the speed required of cryptocurrency and smart contracts.
             BitShares design allows for more transactions per second than VISA and MasterCard combined. Delegated Proof of Stake enables BitShares to confirm a transaction within 1.5 seconds on average.</p>
		  <br />
		  <h2>Achieving Industry Leading Performance and Scalability</h2>
      <p>BitShares took lessons from the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">LMAX Exchange</a>, to achieve industry-leading performance and scalability. LMAX is able to process 6 million transactions per second. These were the key lesson points:</p>
			<ol class="ml-50">
				<li>Keep everything in memory.</li>
				<li>Keep the core business logic in a single thread.</li>
				<li>Keep cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) out of the core business logic.</li>
				<li>Divide validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks.</li>
				<li>Use an object oriented data model.</li>
			</ol>
		  			<p>Following these simple rules, BitShares scalability runs up to 100,000 tps. This is without any significant effort devoted to optimization.
              Future optimizations could bring the performance and scalability of BitShares to LMAX levels.</p>
			<p>Transactional scalability achieved by BitShares is dependent upon having a compatible transaction protocol.
        It would be impossible to achieve the same level of scalability and performance with the Core Business Logic running in a virtual machine,
        performing cryptographic operations and references on all objects with hash identifiers. Performance of a single CPU core is a scalability
        bottleneck in single-threaded blockchains. BitShares aims to get the most out of this single thread of execution.</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="background">Industry Background</h2>
			<p>A blockchain is a global ledger that orders transactions. Each transaction deterministically modifies a shared global state at a specified timestamp.
        The order which transactions get processed can change the validity of other transactions. For example, you cannot withdraw money from your bank
        until your paycheck clears. It is impossible to know whether a transaction is valid, before processing all prior transactions that impact a specific account.</p>
			<p>In theory, transactions for two unrelated accounts could process at the same time, if they do not share any common dependency. In practice,
        the cost of identifying which transactions are independent of each other on a ledger empowered by smart contracts with arbitrary conditions is
        intractable. The only way to be sure that two transactions are truly independent, is by maintaining completely separate ledgers and then periodically transferring value between them. An analogy could be the performance trade-offs in the design of Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) vs Uniform Memory Access.</p>
			<p>In practice, Uniform Memory Access is much easier and lower cost for developers to design for. NUMA architecture is usually adopted last resort,
        on supercomputers or giant clusters.</p>
			<p>The computer industry has grown to realize that increases in scalability and performance through parallelism are nowhere near as easy as the
        early days. In the past all that was necessary was to increase the clock speed of the CPU. It is for this reason that CPU designers pushed the
        single-threaded performance to the limits, before attempting multi-threaded approaches. When multi-threading is not enough, then, and only then,
        is cluster computing considered an option.</p>
			<p>Many in the cryptocurrency industry have attempted to solve the scalability issue by immediately moving to a “cluster” solution.
        BitShares knew scalability meant exploring what is possible on a single core of a single computer in full.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="lmax-disruptor">The LMAX Disruptor</h2>
			<p>The LMAX Disruptor provides a case study on high scalability and performance architecture.
        LMAX shows what is achievable within a single execution thread. LMAX is a retail trading platform that aims to be the fastest
        exchange in the world. They have been generous enough to make public what they learned.</p>
			<p>Here is a brief overview of the LMAX architecture:</p>
			<p>The Business Logic Processor is where all of the sequential transactions and order matching is processed. It is a
			single thread that is able to process millions of orders per second. This architecture is readily ported to the realm
			of cryptocurrencies and blockchain designs.</p>
			<p>The role of the Input Disruptor is to gather orders from users from many different sources and assign them in a deterministic order.
        After assigning them an order they become replicated, logged, and broadcast to many redundant business logic processors.
        The tasks of the Input Disruptor are parallel and farmed out to a cluster of computers.</p>
			<p>After the Business Logic Processor has processed the inputs, an Output Disruptor takes care of notifying anyone who
        cares about the results. This is also a highly parallel task.</p>
			<p>LMAX was able to process 6 million transactions per second through the Business Logic Processor using a single core
        of a commodity CPU and Java virtual machine. Proof there's no need for cryptocurrency and smart contract platforms to
        reach for clustered solutions, when they are not even processing 10 transactions per second.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="high-performance-blockchains">High Performance and Scalability on Blockchains</h2>
			<p>To put in place high performance and scalability on the blockchain, BitShares must adopt the same techniques used by LMAX.
        Some key requirements are:</p>
			<ul class="ml-50">
			<li>Keep everything in memory.</li>
			<li>Avoid synchronization primitives (locks, atomic operations).</li>
			<li>Minimize unnecessary computation in the business logic processor.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Memory is becoming cheaper every day because it is extremely parallel in its design.
        The amount of information required to track the account balance and permissions of every person on the Internet
        is less than 1 Terabyte of RAM. It can cost less than $15,000 and be installed on commodity (high-end) server motherboards.
        Long before 3 billion people adopt the system, this kind of hardware will be in the average desktop.</p>
			<p>Memory isn't the real bottleneck, bandwidth is critical to performance and scalability. At 1 million transactions per second
        and 256 bytes per transaction, the network would need 256 megabytes per second (1 Gbit/sec).
        This kind of bandwidth is not available to the average desktop; but it is a fraction of the 100 Gbit/s that
        <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/vision-initiatives/initiatives/innovation-platform/" target="_blank">Internet 2</a> furnishes
        to more than 210 U.S. educational institutions, 70 corporations, and 45 non-profit and government agencies.</p>
			<p>For scalability and performance, a well designed blockchain keeps everything in RAM to handle millions of transactions per second</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="avoid-hashes-assign-ids-instead">Avoid Hashes, Assign IDs Instead</h2>
			<p>In a single threaded system, CPU cycles are a scarce resource that need conserving. Traditional blockchain designs use
        cryptographic hashes to generate globally unique IDs that are statistically guaranteed to never have a collision.
        The problem with these hashes is that they need much more memory and more CPU cycles to manipulate. It takes a lot more CPU time to look
        up an account record by hash than with a direct array index. For example, 64 bit integers are easier to compare and manipulate than 160+bit IDs.
        Larger hash IDs means there is less room in the CPU cache and that requires more memory. On modern operating systems, seldom accessed RAM gets
        compressed, yet hash identifiers are random un-compressible data.</p>
			<p>Luckily, blockchains give us a means to globally assign unique IDs.
        They do not conflict with one another, so it is possible to completely remove the need to use hash-based identifiers.
        Long hex Bitcoin addresses to refer to an account, balance, or permission are not needed.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="remove-signature-verification-from-business-logic-processor">Remove Signature Verification from Business Logic Processor</h2>
			<p>All transactions on cryptocurrency networks depend upon cryptographic signatures to validate permissions. In the
        general case, the permissions required can change as a result of other transactions. This means that permissions need
        defining in terms that need no cryptographic calculations within the Business Logic Processor.</p>
			<p>To do this, every public key needs to be assigned a unique and immutable ID. After an ID has been assigned, the Input Disruptor(s)
        can verify that the signature provided matches the ID specified. By the time the transaction makes it to the Business Logic Processor,
        the only remaining step is to check the IDs.</p>

			<p>This same technique can be used to remove pre-condition checking on any immutable object with a static ID.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="design-transactions-for-static-validation">Design Transactions for Static Validation</h2>
			<p>Many transaction properties can be checked statically, without the need to reference the current global state.<br/>
			These checks include range checking of parameters, de-duplication of inputs, sort order of arrays, etc.
      Generally speaking, many checks get performed if the transaction includes the data it “assumes” about
      the global state. After these checks are performed, all that is necessary for the Business Logic Processor to do is
       make sure the “assumptions” are still true, which usually boils down to checking a modification timestamp on
       objects referenced relative to the time the transaction got signed.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="smart-contracts">Smart Contracts</h2>
			<p>Many blockchains are adopting a general purpose scripting language to define all operations. These designs end up
			defining the “Business Logic Processor” as a virtual machine and all transactions get defined as scripts to be run by
			the virtual machine. This approach takes the single-threaded limitations of a real CPU and compounds them by forcing
			everything through a virtual CPU. A virtual CPU, even with Just-In-Time compilation, will always be slower than a
			real CPU, but pure speed of calculation isn’t the only issue with the “everything is a script” approach.</p>
			<p>When transactions get defined at such a low level, it means that most of the static checks and cryptographic
        operations get sucked back into the Business Logic Processing and the overall throughput falls. A scripting
        engine should never require a cryptographic signature check to be performed even if it is done through a native call.</p>
			<p>Based upon the lessons we learn from LMAX, we know that a virtual machine for a blockchain should be designed with
        single-threaded performance in mind. This means it should get optimized for Just-In-Time compilation from the beginning,
        and that the most frequently used smart contracts should be supported natively by the blockchain, leaving only the
        rarely-used custom contracts to run in a virtual machine. These custom contracts should be designed around performance,
        which means the Virtual Machine should limit the addressable memory to something that will fit within the CPU cache.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="object-oriented-data-model">Object Oriented Data Model</h2>
			<p>One of the benefits of keeping everything in memory is that the software can be designed to mimic the real-world
        relationships of data. This means that the Business Logic Processor can quickly follow in-memory pointers to the
        data it needs, rather than being forced to perform expensive database queries. It also means that data can be accessed
        without copying it, and that the data can be modified in-place. This single optimization offers an order-of-magnitude
        performance gain over using a database-based approach.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="transaction-sizes">Transaction Sizes</h2>
			<p>A blockchain that processes 100,000 transactions every second generates a lot of data. The average size of a transaction
        on competing networks, such as Ripple and Bitcoin, is about 250 bytes. A similar transaction on BitShares averages just
        100 bytes. In other words, competing systems require 2.5 times the bandwidth to propagate the same number of transactions.
        Assuming a gigabit connection to the internet, it would take about 0.1 seconds just to transfer a block containing 100,000
        transactions. Competing networks would need 0.25 seconds. After latency and multiple hops on a peer-to-peer network are
        factored in, it becomes clear that transaction size directly impacts the block interval, and therefore the confirmation latency.</p>
			<p>Transaction sizes indicate the amount of data the CPU must process in its critical path. Therefore, they serve as an signal of
        how soon the single threaded performance of a CPU will be hit.</p>
			<p>Some optimizations are possible in all protocols if they assume that all nodes have prior knowledge of all broadcast
        transactions and only need the ordered list of transaction IDs to broadcast every block. This would be an implementation detail.</p>

			<br />
			<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Designing a high performance blockchain with scalability isn’t rocket-science. It doesn’t need complex, hard-to-understand
        protocols. Nor must it be processing among all the nodes on the network. All that is necessary to build a high-performance
        blockchain is to remove all calculations that are not part of the critical, order-dependent, evaluation from the core business
        logic. Also, to design a protocol that facilitates these kinds of optimizations. This is what BitShares has done.</p>
